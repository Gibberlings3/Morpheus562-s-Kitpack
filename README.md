## Introduction

These kits are inspired from various areas to include 5e subclasses and NWN2 Prestige Classes. I would like to explicitly note the phenomenal work that Kaedrin did with introducing many new Prestige Classes to NWN2 and I borrow from his work to bring them into the Infinity Engine. There is more to come, but what is listed below is fully functional.

## Fighters

### Battle Master

An expert in two-handed weapons, the Battle Master is able to wreak havok on any battlefield. Their ferocity and resilience is well renowned, and enemies fear the endless barrage of their attacks. 

Advantages:
- 1st Level: May use the Charge ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1, one use at level 3, and an additional use every 3 levels thereafter.

CHARGE: The Battle Master is able to increase his movement speed by +5 for 3 seconds.

- 4th Level: May use the Relentless Assault ability once per day and gains an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

RELENTLESS ASSAULT: The Battle Master is able to unleash a flurry of blows and doubles the amount of attacks they can do for 5 rounds.

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls for 2 rounds.

Disadvantages:
- May only attain Grandmaster in two-handed weapons while all other weapons can only attain Proficient.

### Battlerager

Battleragers are a type of dwarf warrior whose combat style relies on raw instinct, anger, and physical strength. The individuals who practice this type of fighting are usually mentally unstable with a low life expectancy. The infamous battlerager fighting style relies on individuals immersing themselves completely into battle, often at the expense of their own personal safety.

Advantages:
- May use Reckless Abandon ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

RECKLESS ABANDON: The character becomes enraged for 1 turn. While enraged, the character gains a +10% bonus to <PRO_HISHER> damage rolls and becomes immune to charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, hold, imprisonment, level drain, maze, stun, and sleep. The character also receives a -2 penalty to Armor Class, takes 1 point of damage per round while enraged (knocking the character unconscious if this causes the character's hit points to be reduced to 0), and receives +10% increase to all physical damage taken.

- 5th Level: Gains the Spiked Armor passive ability.

SPIKED ARMOR: Any enemy who damages the Battlerager will receive 1d4 points of piercing damage.

Disadvantages:
- Becomes winded after Reckless Abandon: -2 penalty to movement rate, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.
- May not use ranged weapons.
- Race restricted to dwarf.
- Alignment restricted to any non-lawful.

### Dragoon

Dragoons are warriors who dedicate their lives to the use of polearm weapons (quarterstaff, spear, and halberd). These warriors focus on keeping their enemies at long reach while quickly maneuvering around the battlefield.

Advantages:
- Moves 2 points faster than other characters.
- Skill with polearms (quarterstaff, spear, and halberd) allows the Dragoon to have a 20% chance to knock an enemy back a few feet when hit and deal additional piercing damage. A successful save vs. Death with a -2 penalty negates being knocked back. Damage dealt increases with levels as follows:
  Level 1-2: 1 piercing
  Level 3-5: 1d4 piercing
  Level 6-8: 1d6 piercing
  Level 9-11: 1d8 piercing
  Level 12-14: 2d4 piercing
  Level 15-17: 1d10 piercing
  Level 18-20: 2d6 piercing
  Level 21+: 1d20 piercing

- 3rd Level: May use the Leap Attack ability once per day and gains an additional use every 3 levels thereafter.

LEAP ATTACK: The Dragoon will instantly leap at an enemy within 15 feet dealing piercing damage and stunning the enemy for 2 seconds. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 per level of the Dragoon, or half with a successful Saving Throw vs. Death.

Disadvantages:
- May only attain Grandmaster in polearm weapons (quarterstaff, spear, and halberd) while all other weapons can only attain Proficient.

### Psi Warrior

A Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Psi Warriors hone their skills and psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.

Advantages:
- 3rd Level: May use Psionic Strike once per day and gains an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

### Shield Breaker

Shield Breakers are a specialized set of fighters whose main purpose is to break the ranks and defenses of an enemy front line. These fighters will rend and penetrate enemy armor and defenses to make them vulnerable, so their allies may exploit this newly exposed weakness. As a result, the Shield Breaker's attacks will not hit as hard since they are made to break armor and shields, not sever bones and sinew.

- May not use ranged weapons.
- May not use shields.

### Deathbringer (Prestige Kit)
