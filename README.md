## Introduction

These kits are inspired from various areas to include 5e subclasses and NWN2 Prestige Classes. I would like to explicitly note the phenomenal work that Kaedrin did with introducing many new Prestige Classes to NWN2 and I borrow from his work to bring them into the Infinity Engine. There is more to come, but what is listed below is fully functional.

## Fighters

### Battle Master

An expert in two-handed weapons, the Battle Master is able to wreak havok on any battlefield. Their ferocity and resilience is well renowned, and enemies fear the endless barrage of their attacks. 

Advantages:
- 1st Level: May use the Charge ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1, one use at level 3, and an additional use every 3 levels thereafter.

CHARGE: The Battle Master is able to increase his movement speed by +5 for 3 seconds.

- 4th Level: May use the Relentless Assault ability once per day and gains an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

RELENTLESS ASSAULT: The Battle Master is able to unleash a flurry of blows and doubles the amount of attacks they can do for 5 rounds.

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls for 2 rounds.

- 9th Level: Gains the Indomitable passive ability.

INDOMITABLE: The Battle Master gains +1 bonus to all saving throws. This increases to a +2 bonus at level 13 and a +3 bonus at level 17.

Disadvantages:
- May only attain Grandmaster in two-handed weapons while all other weapons can only attain Proficient.

### Dragoon

Dragoons are heavily armored warriors who dedicate their lives to the use of polearm weapons (quarterstaff, spear, and halberd). These warriors focus on keeping their enemies at long reach while maneuvering around the battlefield at the expense of their own protection.

Advantages:
- Moves 2 points faster than other characters.
- Skill with polearms (quarterstaff, spear, and halberd) allows the Dragoon to have a 20% chance to knock an enemy back a few feet when hit and deal additional piercing damage. A successful save vs. Death with a -2 penalty negates being knocked back. Damage dealt increases with levels as follows:
  Level 1-2: 1 piercing
  Level 3-5: 1d4 piercing
  Level 6-8: 1d6 piercing
  Level 9-11: 1d8 piercing

HAMSTRING: The Dragoon's attacks for the next 10 seconds will progressively slow the movement of any struck enemy by -1. The penalty from each hit is cumulative and will last for 2 rounds. A successful save vs. Death with a -4 penalty negates the penalty to movement speed. 

Disadvantages:
- May not dual class.
- May only attain Grandmaster in polearm weapons (quarterstaff, spear, and halberd) while all other weapons can only attain Proficient.

### Psi Warrior

A Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Psi Warriors hone their skills and psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.

Advantages:
- 3rd Level: May use Psionic Strike once per day and gains an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.
- 3rd Level: May use Protective Field once per day and gains an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

- 7th Level: May use Telekinetic Movement once per day and gains an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

TELEKINETIC MOVEMENT: The Psi Warrior can move a creature with his mind. The Psi Warrior may select to push or pull the target to himself.

### Shield Breaker

Shield Breakers are a specialized set of fighters whose main purpose is to break the ranks and defenses of an enemy front line. These fighters will rend and penetrate enemy armor and defenses to make them vulnerable, so their allies may exploit this newly exposed weakness. As a result, the Shield Breaker's attacks will not hit as hard since they are made to break armor and shields, not sever bones and sinew. 

Advantages:
- Each successful hit has a 25% chance of bestowing a -10% cumulative reduction in the target's physical damage resistance that lasts for 4 rounds.
- 4th Level: May use Sunder ability once per day and gains an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

SUNDER: The Shield Breaker sunders the earth before him striking all enemies within a 15-ft. radius. Enemies struck will receive 2d4 crushing damage, -25% reduction in physical damage resistance for 5 rounds, and falls to the ground for 3 seconds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -4 penalty negates the fall. 

NOTE: The reduction in physical damage resistance is not stackable with multiple uses of Sunder.

Disadvantages:
- Weapons receive a -2 penalty to all damage rolls.
- May not use ranged weapons.
- May not use shields.

### Deathbringer (Prestige Kit)

Deathbringers are a special group of warriors of Bhaal trained in the art of intimidation and war. Those trained in the ways of the Deathbringer may fell their foes with a single blow, and every enemy slain at their hand fuels their rage and ferocity.. They are also a group of scattered cultists that are still trying to revive Bhaal, even though his essence is locked up in the Upper Planes.

Advantages:
- 15th Level: Gains the Carnage passive ability.

CARNAGE: When the Deathbringer slays an opponent, his rage and ferocity is fueled dealing an additional +10% physical damage for two rounds. This ability stacks with itself.

- 17th Level: Gains the Deathbringer Assault passive ability.

DEATHBRINGER ASSAULT: The Deathbringer has a 3% on hit of dealing an additional +200 slashing damage with a 10% of stunning the target for 2 rounds. A successful save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty negates being stunned.

- 20th Level: May use the Savage Blows ability once per day and gains an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

SAVAGE BLOWS: The Deathbringer's attacks for the next 10 seconds will progressively weaken any struck opponent. The hit target will lose 1 point of strength per hit for the next 2 rounds.

Disadvantages:
- Alignment restricted to evil.
- May not dual class.

Please note, this prestige kit requires a player meet the following prerequisite requirements:
- Must be the protagonist

- No kits nor multi/dual classing
- Must be evil alignment 

## Rangers

### Rashemaar Berserker

Disadvantages:

### Champion of the Wild

Champions of the Wild embody discipline and skill and relies on quickness, agility, and an almost scholarly study of the most difficult and advanced techniques of swordplay instead of brute power. In order to become a Champion of the Wild, an initiate must excel in swordplay and exhibit patience, grace, and compassion. To take joy only in feat of arms is to live a crude and diminished life. There is more to life than fighting well, and the true champion knows this.

Advantages:
- May use Lay On Hands ability once per day to heal a target for 2 Hit Points per level of the Champion of the Wild.

- 2nd Level: Gains the Elegant Strike passive ability.

- 6th Level: Gains the Superior Defense passive ability.

## Sorcerers

### Eldritch Scion

Unlike typical mages, Eldritch Scions do not study tomes of magic or spend time learning to combine martial and magical skills. Rather, Eldritch Scions find that their spells and abilities come to them instinctively.

- 8th Level: Gains .5 APR.
- 15th Level: Gains an additional .5 APR.

Disadvantages:
- Receive a -2 penalty to casting speed.
- Receive a -2 penalty to casting level.

## Multiclass

### Stormlord - Fighter/Druid Multiclass Kit

Stormlords wield thunder and lightning like a warrior wields his sword. Because of their command of one of the most destructive aspects of nature, Stormlords are viewed with awe and fear by lesser folk, regardless of their motivation.
