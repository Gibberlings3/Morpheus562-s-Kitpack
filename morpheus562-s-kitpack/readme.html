<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>These kits are inspired from various areas to include 5e subclasses and NWN2 Prestige Classes. I would like to explicitly note the phenomenal work that Kaedrin did with introducing many new Prestige Classes to NWN2 and I borrow from his work to bring them into the Infinity Engine. There is more to come, but what is listed below is fully functional.</p>

<h2 id="fighters">Fighters</h2>
<h3 id="battle-master">Battle Master</h3>
<p>An expert in two-handed weapons, the Battle Master is able to wreak havok on any battlefield. Their ferocity and resilience is well renowned, and enemies fear the endless barrage of their attacks.</p>

<h3 id="dragoon">Dragoon</h3>

<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Moves 2 points faster than other characters.</p>

<h3 id="shield-breaker">Shield Breaker</h3>
<p>Shield Breakers are a specialized set of fighters whose main purpose is to break the ranks and defenses of an enemy front line. These fighters will rend and penetrate enemy armor and defenses to make them vulnerable, so their allies may exploit this newly exposed weakness. As a result, the Shield Breaker's attacks will not hit as hard since they are made to break armor and shields, not sever bones and sinew.</p>

<li>May not use shields.</li>

In order to become a Champion of the Wild, an initiate must excel in swordplay and exhibit patience, grace, and compassion. To take joy only in feat of arms is to live a crude and diminished life.

<h2 id="sorcerers">Sorcerers</h2>
<h3 id="eldritch-scion">Eldritch Scion</h3>
