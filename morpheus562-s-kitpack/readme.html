<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>These kits are inspired from various areas to include 5e subclasses and NWN2 Prestige Classes. I would like to explicitly note the phenomenal work that Kaedrin did with introducing many new Prestige Classes to NWN2 and I borrow from his work to bring them into the Infinity Engine. There is more to come, but what is listed below is fully functional.</p>

<h3 id="battlerager">Battlerager</h3>
<p>Battleragers are a type of dwarf warrior whose combat style relies on raw instinct, anger, and physical strength. The individuals who practice this type of fighting are usually mentally unstable with a low life expectancy. The infamous battlerager fighting style relies on individuals immersing themselves completely into battle, often at the expense of their own personal safety.</p>

While enraged, the character gains a +10% bonus to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; damage rolls and becomes immune to charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, hold, imprisonment, level drain, maze, stun, and sleep. The character also receives a -2 penalty to Armor Class, takes 1 point of damage per round while enraged (knocking the character unconscious if this causes the character's hit points to be reduced to 0), and receives +10% increase to all physical damage taken.</p>
<ul>

They drag foes into one-on-one conflicts and often gird themselves in heavy armor. Death Knight talents can bolster their defensive abilities by focusing on their ability to heal themselves, increase their damage and spell attacks, or summon forth minions and diseases.</p>

<h3 id="archmage">Archmage</h3>
<p>Archmages are powerful, and usually quite old, spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom.

<p>ARCANE FIRE: Archmage learns to channel arcane energy as a weapon, ensuring they are armed even when their spells run dry. This ability allows the Archmage to fire a pulse of magical energy that deals 1d6/class level damage to a single creature. Magic Resistance is bypassed by this ability.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-scion">Eldritch Scion</h3>
<p>Unlike typical mages, Eldritch Scions do not study tomes of magic or spend time learning to combine martial and magical skills. Rather, Eldritch Scions find that their spells and abilities come to them instinctively.</p>
